<h1> <font color="bluess"> What is Search Engine Optimization? </h1> </font>
<h3> <p><font color="black"> SEO is short for search engine optimization. Search engine optimization is a methodology of strategies, techniques and tactics used to increase the amount of visitors to a website by obtaining a high-ranking placement in the search results page of a search engine (SERP) - including Google, Bing, Yahoo and other search engines. 

<p> Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a web search engine's unpaid results-often referred to as "natural", "organic", or "earned" results.  In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users; these visitors can then be converted into customers. </p>


<p> SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, video search, academic search, news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines. SEO differs from local search engine optimization in that the latter is focused on optimizing a business' online presence so that its web pages will be displayed by search engines when a user enters a local search for its products or services. The former instead is more focused on national searches. </h3> </p> </font> 


<h1><font color="bluess">  Guidelines on how to read a Search Engine Result Page. </h1> </font>
<h3> <p><font color="black"> The link structure of the web serves to bind all of the pages together.

<p> Links allow the search engines' automated robots, called "crawlers" or "spiders," to reach the many billions of interconnected documents on the web. </p>

<p> Once the engines find these pages, they decipher the code from them and store selected pieces in massive databases, to be recalled later when needed for a search query. To accomplish the monumental task of holding billions of pages that can be accessed in a fraction of a second, the search engine companies have constructed datacenters all over the world. </p>

<p> These monstrous storage facilities hold thousands of machines processing large quantities of information very quickly. When a person performs a search at any of the major engines, they demand results instantaneously; even a one- or two-second delay can cause dissatisfaction, so the engines work hard to provide answers as fast as possible. </h3> </p> </font>


<h1> <font color="bluess"> How SEO Affects Business? </h1> </font>
<h3> <p><font color="black"> - If you are a business, there are some very real, and specific benefits to having a consistent, ongoing search engine optimization strategy. </p> 
<p>For the first time in the history of marketing, users are offering up their actual intent…through the words that they type into search engines.…And more than ever before, you can measure the results of your SEO efforts as a marketing channel. While search engines don't charge you…for listing your web pages,…planning and implementing SEO in your organization is certainly not free. You'll need to spend the time, money, and resources to do this the right way. </p>

<p> The good news is that this can help you…obtain a tremendous marketing reach, attract more targeted visitors and measure the impact of your efforts in terms of a return on your investment. More and more content appears on the web every second of every day and your customers need search engines to help make sense of it all. In fact, the bigger the web gets the more search engine usage continues to grow. People search to find answers to their questions. </p>

<h1> <font color="bluess"> List some of important SEO Expectations </h1>
<h4> <font color="bluess"> Difficult Expectation #1: Speed of Ranking Increases </h4> </font>
<h3> <p><font color="black">	When SEO is done right, rankings will increase. The speed of the increase is something that the SEO specialist only has so much control over. There are many factors at work that it's difficult to make good judgments on how long it will take for a keyword to hit a certain page or position, given that there may be others going after similar keywords with more resources to devote. </p>

<p> As a general rule, it's much easier to jump 10 positions when you're starting on the 10th page than it is to jump 10 positions when you're on the 2nd page of results. What's problematic is when you E-mail to tell a client that some of their main keywords have reached the first page and they respond with expectations of getting those same keywords to the top position within a week. It happens. </p>

<p> There is a timing factor that must be accounted for in SEO and can't be circumvented. If timing were irrelevant, companies would shovel enough money into SEO during month 1 to get the rankings they want. That's not how it works. </p> </font>

<h4> <p> <font color="bluess"> Difficult Expectation #2: Number of Keywords Targeted </h4> </font> </p>
<h3> <p> <font color="black"> Clients want to rank for everything, but most clients aren’t willing to pay to rank for everything at once. And even when they recognize that their SEO budget leaves them shy of being able to tackle some highly competitive terms, they'll inevitably try to get them onto the keyword research list. </p>

<p> You have to communicate that increasing the volume of keywords only dilutes the amount of work being done on each keyword. I've seen campaigns die a painful, drawn-out death because the keyword list was too broad initially for the amount of time budgeted to spend on the campaign. The end of the initial contract came and all of the keywords were sitting on page 2 or 3, on the cusp of success, but unable to drive the traffic, leads, and revenues needed to justify the expense. Don't make that mistake. When in doubt, side with a narrow list. </p>

<p> If a client wants you to track and report on keywords (even related terms) that aren't part of the link-building focus, just say no. It's hard when they claim to fully recognize that you won't be working on those keywords, but trust me when I say that you won't be able to keep a client from becoming emotionally invested in the terms. You're better off introducing them to ways to track their own rankings using something. </p>

<h4> <p> <font color="bluess"> Difficult Expectation #3: Quantity of Backlinks </font> </p> </h4>
<h3> <p> <font color="black"> SEO companies should be reporting on the backlinks they're requesting and successfully building. Clients have come to expect this. But when clients start calculating their "cost per link" and talk about quitting in favor of "cheaper links" from another country, you know there's a disconnect. 
</p>

<p>One of the most commonly screwed up expectations is that of link quantity. If SEO success were based solely on the quantity of links built, you can bet that SEO would have a much different look and feel to it – a very robotic, automated look and feel. Search engines would also have a very difficult time trying to serve up relevant content, which is why it doesn't work like that. Search engines want a natural-looking backlink portfolio, which means a necessary influx of both quantity and quality-driven backlinks. </p>

<p> Also keep in mind that the volume of links built in any given period is likely to fluctuate based on the distribution of link building techniques being used as well as what the site needs at any given time. </p> </b>
